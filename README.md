# landing-page

I forgot to write something here before to lay out the page. 


Now, i only can say that i could aply the concepts learning about css, especially those related to flexbox.
It has been very complicated and forced me to do a lot of research about what I read in the course, but I feel that I reinforced what I learned and I feel satisfied with it. Now I'm going to take a few days off, and then continue with Javascript!

The images that i used to lay out this page where taken from: https://pixabay.com
